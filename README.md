# Extended Loadouts + Wheel Selector

**Not enough loadouts in Mycopunk?**  
Thatâ€™s no longer a problem â€” with this mod, you can have **more than 3 loadouts** default **5**, but can be increased up to **8**, and **switch between them mid-game** using a smooth, in-game **Loadout Wheel**.

---

## Overview
By default, **Mycopunk** lets you change loadouts during gameplay â€” but **most players donâ€™t even know this feature exists**.  
This mod **amplifies** that mechanic to the next level by:
- Increasing the **number of loadouts** (configurable in settings).
- Adding an intuitive **Loadout Wheel** for **fast mid-game switching**.
- Making strategic loadout swaps a **core part of your gameplay**.

---

## Features
- **Configurable maximum loadouts** (default: **5**, max:**8**, including the initial 3).
- **Radial Loadout Wheel** for quick switching.
- **Three configurable quick-swap keys**:
    - **Held Weapon** â†’ Default: `H`
    - **Grenade** â†’ Default: `J`
    - **Employee** â†’ Default: `K`
- **Fully configurable number of keys** and their bindings via the config file.
- **Configurable cooldown** between loadout changes (default: **45 seconds**).
- **Configurable self-damage on swap** for balancing purposes *(currently bugged due to how self-damage is applied in-game)*.
- Seamless integration with the base gameâ€™s loadout system â€” no save wipes.

---

## Balancing
To prevent abuse of rapid swapping, loadouts can only be changed once every **45 seconds** *(default â€” adjustable in config)*.  
You also take **percentage-based self-damage** when swapping *(configurable, but currently not working as intended â€” see known issues)*.

---

## Planned Features
- Option to **rename loadouts**.
- More **icon choices** for each loadout.
- Configure **loadouts size** and **bindings** in game.

---

## Installation
1. Install via **Thunderstore Mod Manager** *(recommended)* or manually drop the files into `BepInEx/plugins`.
2. Configure your preferences in the generated config file after first run.
3. Launch Mycopunk and start swapping!

---

## Controls
- **Hold Loadout Wheel Key** â†’ Open the wheel and highlight a loadout with mouse/stick.
- **Release** â†’ Instantly switch to that loadout *(if cooldown allows)*.
- Use your **configured quick-swap keys** for direct loadout access.

---

## Compatibility
- Tested with the latest version of Mycopunk.
- Client-side only works in multiplayer.
- Should work with other mods that **donâ€™t override loadout handling**.
